# Sorting Algorithm Visualiser
Build a visualiser that animates the sorting process of various sorting algorithms to assist learning of CS alogrithms. Users can control the steps at their own pace.

<div align="center">
  <img src="img/anim.gif" alt-"sigmoid" width="500" height="300">
</div>

## Results
An animation showcases sorting processes of Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort and Selection Sort.

## Improvement
1. Add more algorithms.
2. Use a more high-level and visually appealing library such as Plotly.

## Software and Libraries
- Python 3.9
- Matplotlib
